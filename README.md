# Voltorb Flip Solver
Attempt at making a solver for the minigame Voltorb Flip from Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver.
There's no such thing as a perfect solver to this game since it's partly RNG.
This one uses simple math to recognize if a tile has any merit in flipping.
It does not take into account what round you're on.
This board also calculates the tile with highest merit (least chance of voltorb and biggest of higher number).
It showcases this with a golden border around the tile with highest merit.
I tried making it look aesthetically pleasing as well as close to the original.

If I ever revisit this project I might let you play the game as well as solve boards.
